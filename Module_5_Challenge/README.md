# PyBer Analysis

## Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to analyze ride-sharing data between three city types, Urban, Suburban and Rural for V. Isualize

## Results: 
 

o   Results of the analysis show that there are 30.8 more total drivers in Urban cities than there are in Rural cities, and and 4.9 times more drivers in Urban cities than in Suburban cities. This is to be expected because with higher populations in Urban cities, the need for ride-sharing also increases. Consequently, the average fare per ride is higher in Rural areas than it is in Urban areas, again this is expected as there are less ride-shares in Rural areas, therefore leading to higher fares per ride. 

## Summary - Recommendations
1.	Increase drivers in Rural Areas

The data shows that there is opportunity in increasing the number of drivers and rides in Rural areas. The rural areas are underserved and if there were more rides, the cost per ride would go down, but that would encourage riders in these rural areas to use more ride-sharing options, which would increase bottom line for the company

2.	Incentivize drivers to operate in Rural areas

Following the point above, the company should find ways to give drivers incentives, for them to want to operate in the underserved markets (especially Rural cities). Because of supply and demand laws, the drivers also stand to generate more money, considering that the average fare per ride is $34.62 in rural areas vs $24.53 in urban areas, and a significant $55.49 average fare per driver in rural areas compared to $16.57 in Urban cities

3.	Limit new drivers in Urban areas

There is no big jump in rewards for drivers driving in Urban areas, because the data shows that Urban cities are well covered in terms of total drivers. Although a little risky, consideration should be given to not allow any new drivers to operate in the Urban cities. Any new drivers should be required to drive in the Rural areas, at least for a while. We have seen that there is value in diverting more drivers to rural areas, so this would be one way to ensure that the rural areas are not being left out of the ride-sharing rides
